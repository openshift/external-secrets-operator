          ExternalSecretsConfig describes configuration and information about the managed external-secrets deployment.
          The name must be `cluster` as ExternalSecretsConfig is a singleton, allowing only one instance per cluster.

          When an ExternalSecretsConfig is created, the controller installs the external-secrets and keeps it in the desired state.

                            Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can
                            tolerate all taints of a particular category.

                            negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.

                                  any service environment variables. If a variable cannot be resolved,
                                  the reference in the input string will be unchanged. Double $$ are reduced
                                  to a single $, which allows for escaping the $(VAR_NAME) syntax: i.e.
                                  "$$(VAR_NAME)" will produce the string literal "$(VAR_NAME)".
                                  Escaped references will never be expanded, regardless of whether the variable
                                  exists or not.
